Format of CPUPerf Files
=======================

Paths to counters can be determined from the Windows Performance admin tool
which can be found as Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Performance.

Counters are of one of the following formats:
	\performance object\counter
	\performance object(instance)\counter

An example of the first sort is the system up time, which is:
	\System\System Up Time

An example of the second sort is the processor time:
	\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time

These match the object, instance, and counter parameters that are specified
in the Windows Performance admin tool when adding counters to monitor.

Each file generated by CPUPerf is derived from one or more of these
performance counters, and the format of each one is given below. Every file
generally has a '#samples' field. This is the number of samples taken from
the performance counters for the file since the service was started.
