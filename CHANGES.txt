Changes between 0.02 and 0.03
-----------------------------

- Tranferred development from Visual C++ 6 to Visual C++ 2005 Express

- Changes to the main service code to fix problems with general service
  and thread handling:
	- startCPUPerf() is now started as a thread, so ServiceMain()
	  can complete correctly (as discussed in the MSDN)

	- Monitor threads are now shut down gracefully with 
	  WaitForSingleObject and WaitForMultipleObjects

- Changes to all classes to use the secure string handling functions
  _snprintf_s() instead of _snprintf() etc.

- Class CCPerfMon now recognises more (hopefully all) the error numbers
  that pdh.lib can raise, so useful error messages a-go-go

- LoadAverage monitor now includes the number of processors installed in
  a machine when calculating load averages.

- Added this ChangeLog :-)
